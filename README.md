# Recursion_Exercise1
This includes programmes on:-
1] Power of numbers --  Given a number and its reverse. Find that number raised to the power of its own reverse.
Note: As answers can be very large, print the result modulo 109 + 7.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 2, R = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The reverse of 2 is 2 and after raising power of 2 by 2 we get 4 which gives remainder as 4 when divided by 1000000007.

2] Power Using Recursion - You are given two numbers n and p. You need to find np.
Example 1:
Input:
n = 9 p = 9 
Output: 387420489
Explanation: 387420489 is the value 
obtained when 9 is raised to the 
power of 9.


 3] Fibonacci Using Recursion - You are given a number n. You need to find nth Fibonacci number.
F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2); where F(1)=1 and F(2)=1
Example 1:
Input:
n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The first fibonacci
 number is 1

4] Print 1 To N Without Loop - Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
